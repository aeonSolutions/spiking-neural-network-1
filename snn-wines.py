About this program:
This program reads the wine training data of 89 wines and
creates a spiking neural network that uses spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)
synapses for training. It generates a spike sequence for presynaptic and
postsynaptic layers which are used during network training period. After training
the connections between neurons are saved and used for testing on a static synapse 
model that has connections with fixed weights and delay. The network has to classify
wines based on all 13 features

THIS IS A FUTHER STUDY WITH snn-stdp.py WHICH WAS MADE FOR IRIS CLASSIFICATION
